# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a  Twitter sentiment Analysis project in which I have analyzed the views of the people on the recent revoking of section 370A. For this, I scrapped about 98k relevant tweets based on the hashtag '#Article370A' from Twitte using the twitterscrapper python package and performed analysis using the vaderSentiment python package. The Scrapped Twitter data along with the complete analysis has been added in the repository.

Key skills: Data Scraping, Data Cleaning, Sentiment Analysis, Data Visualization(Word Cloud)
